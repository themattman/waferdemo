# WaferDB Demo App

A Demo Web App that showcases WaferDB


## Demo Plan

1) Prove functionality works - open up 3 tabs and perform each CRUD operation with interface

2) Pull open server output to prove it's true

3) Kill the server and show a reconnect

4) Show the file format of the server_cache_backup

5) Swap out redis for mongodb and perform CRUD

6) Swap out mongo for a cloud service, pull open cloud service to show the data is there

7) Run a stress test with a live graph to show performance

8) Side by side with something that doesn't use wafer

9) Run on AWS and show how many clients can use it - have teammates open 10 tabs each for a total of 30 clients connected
