# WaferDB Demo App

A Demo Web App that showcases WaferDB


## Demo Plan

1) Delete node_modules/ so you can do `npm install` on the waferdemo

2) Prove functionality works - open up 3 tabs and perform each CRUD operation with interface

3) Pull open server output to prove it's true

4) Kill the server and show a reconnect

5) Show the file format of the server_cache_backup

6) Swap out redis for mongodb and perform CRUD

7) Swap out mongo for a cloud service, pull open cloud service to show the data is there

8) Run a stress test with a live graph to show performance

9) Side by side with something that doesn't use wafer

10) Run on AWS and show how many clients can use it - have teammates open 10 tabs each for a total of 30 clients connected
